## DP3T
The Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) project is an open protocol for COVID-19 proximity tracing using Bluetooth Low Energy functionality on mobile devices that ensures personal data and computation stays entirely on an individual's phone. It was produced by a core team of over 25 scientists and academic researchers from across Europe. It has also been scrutinized and improved by the wider community.

DP-3T is a free-standing effort started at EPFL and ETHZ that produced this protocol and that is implementing it in an open-sourced app and server.


## Introduction
This is the first implementation of a client using the [DP3T Android SDK](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android). You can install the app on [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/dp-3t/apps/nextstep-android/distribution_groups/internal).
